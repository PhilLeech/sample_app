# Ruby on Rails Tutorial
## Sample Application From Micheal Hartl's Rails Tutorial

I decided to go through the Rails Tutorial for several reasons.

* I had taken a break from rails development and I felt like I needed to brush back up on some general concepts.
* I had gone through several Rails courses from Code School and Ruby courses from both Code School and Code Academy before, but I wanted something that really tied everything together towards building a single app.  Micheal Hartl's seemed to offer that.
* The Rails Tutorial involved a lot of RSpec and TDD which I did not get exposure to (although Code School has several RSpec and testing courses that I have not done yet)
